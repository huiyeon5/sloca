Analytical Web Application which shows insights on the the various movement patterns of people in SMU SIS building.

## Technologies Used:

1. Java

First real Software Project done in School. Making a software whilst learning about the Software Development lifecycle/Project Management was a challenge. Also, the algorithms used to find patterns in movements were not easy.

Greatful to all my Team members for this project!
